# PTO
A project aiming at figuring out what are the best days to take PTO provided specific inputs.

Motivation: Sometimes we are given days off, and often times we try to maximize the number of consecutive days we have off. For example: It is preferable for many people, given just one day off, they would likely take that day off on Monday or Friday. 

Given an amount of days, in integers, how can we maximize the amount of consecutive days we can take off in a year. 

Input - X : Int
Output - Y: [np.datetimes]
